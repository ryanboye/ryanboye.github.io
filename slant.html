				<p>Slant is a collaboratively edited Q&amp;A site designed to help people make choices about what products to use or buy. Slant's aim is to take the pain out of product research to help people quickly make informed decisions.</p>
				<p>I was brought in as a contract designer to evaluate some of the pain points of their product, and improve upon as much as possible with a tight schedule and budget.</p>
				<h2>What we started with</h2>
				<p>The core product consists of question pages, and answer pages. Question pages can have multiple answers to that question. Answer pages have facts about the product.</p>
				<p>The primary goal was to increase user interaction on the website. To do that, we wanted to improve the rate that they clicked through past the homepage.</p>
				<h3>The original homepage</h3>

		<div class="row row-img">
			<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-2 caption">
				<strong>Homepage Before</strong> 	The homepage featured large boxes showing the days most popular topics. Each box featured multiple screenshots showing the top solutions, and a prominent red banner showcasing the number one solution.

					<strong>Issues</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Not enough items on page</p></li>
						<li><p>Heirarchy difficult to read</p></li>

				<h2>How can we better show the depth of the content?</h2>
				<p>One of the challenges we tried to solve was how to improve the visual hierarchy on the homepage. Most importantly, how to solve the visual heirarchy of the questions listed.</p>
				<p>The original, and two options are shown below. We took the original, and modified it so that the question felt like the most prominent aspect of the box. Everything else came after in the hierarchy. We introduced extra information from the answer page into this area, to clarify the options available to the user.</p>

				<h2>Iterating on the homepage</h2>
				<p>We experimented a lot with different styles of presenting the information. The goal was to convey to the user that there were many options available to them at a glance, and to convey the pros and cons of each one in a scannable way.</p>
				<p>The first step was to increase the heirarchy of the question to make that the focal point of the page.</p>
				<p>The next step was to shrink the answers to the question to allow the page to become more scannable, allowing the user to get a quick consensus.</p>

				<div class="caption"><strong>Card Style presentation on Tablet (left) &amp; on desktop (right)</strong> This was one idea we tried. We converted the previous answer sections into cards, and adjusted the heirarchy within the card to convey the information appropriately.</div>

				<h2>The Final Design</h2>
				<p>While the card approach seemed like a viable option, we ended up going with a more traditional list view. This design was based heavily off of the original, but with a more compact layout and higher information density. The result is cleaner and easier to scan.</p>

				<div class="caption"><strong>Final Question Page (Left) &amp; Final Homepage (right)</strong> These are the final designs used on the website today.</div>
